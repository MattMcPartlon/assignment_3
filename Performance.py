"""

Compare The running time of your branch and bound code with your code from
week 1.

(e.g. x-axis = problem size, y-axis = time, a line for each version of the
algorithm)

For each algorithm, plot up to the largest problem size
for which your code terminates in <30 seconds... you should be able to plot
out your branch and bound code for larger problem sizes than week1 code.

save the three charts in
(1) ./longest_path.jpg (or .png)
(2) ./max_clique.jpg
(3) ./knapsack.jpg
"""

"""
***BONUS (up to 3 points per algorithm)***
Compare different pruning and bounding methods for an algorithm
and plot the performance difference.
Give a very brief explanation for the observed differences and
save each in their own separate subfolder (just give them a reasonable name)
